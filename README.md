## Project Description
Our group has chosen to build a automatic pill dispensing device to assist users in taking their medication on time. This deice utilizes a servo to automatically open the container so the user can retrieve their medication at a given time set by an rtc module. A passive buzzer chimes to verbally notify the user. An IR receiver is fitted within the device to manually open and close the device to allow the restocking of medication.
